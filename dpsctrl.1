.TH DPSCTRL "1" "2004-2012" "dpsctrl" PoC@pocnet.net
.SH NAME
dpsctrl \- Control Voltcraft DPS series power supply
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpsctrl
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents
.BR dpsctrl .
It may be used to read values and control parameters on Conrad Electronic's
Voltcraft brand power supplies DPS-2010, DPS-4005 and DPS-8003.
.P
.B dpsctrl
tries to open the (serial) device identified by the environment
variable
.B DPSDEVICE
(see below).
.P
If
.B DPSDEVICE
is not set, dpsctrl per default tries to open 
.B /dev/dps
which can be a symbolic link to the appropriate serial port device on your system. Since
udev is now used in every recent distro, I recommend setting
.B DPSDEVICE
in your ~/.profile.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
output brief help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
output version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
when setting output voltage, loop (at most three times) while setting voltage anew,
until dps-value matches the requested value. This is to circumvent a bug in dps
firmware which prevents setting an exact value in one shot. Parameter is
ignored for any other request than -u. Will also work when using curses mode.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
continously read values from the DPS and print them on stdout.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR
read values once from the DPS and then exit. This is useful for batches.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR
toggle output relais.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
value required. Set output voltage to the given value in Volts, which may not
be greater than 81V.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR
value requeired. Set voltage limit to the given value in Volts, which must be
an integer value.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR
value required. Set current limit to the given value in Milliamperes, which
must me an integer value. Please note that the minimum stepwidth is 10mA.
.PP
All provided values will get interpreted to the maximum digit count the DPS can
handle for the given parameter. All further (and less significant) digits will
be cut off. No rounding at the moment!
.PP
When given no arguments and USE_CURSES was set in the Makefile at compile time
you'll be presented with a nice interactive interface. Press the keys shown in
the status line and watch what happens.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Setting environment variables is dependant on which shell is in use. Currently,
most distros set bash as default shell. For this, VAR=value is sufficient.
.TP
\fBDPSDEVICE\fR
Full path to the serial device, the dps is actually hooked up to.
.SH BUGS
Sometimes, setting many parameters in one commandline fails. The DPS will then
adjust to seemingly random values. This may be related to output buffering of
the serial port. Call
.B dpsctrl
multiple times with less parameters to circumvent this.
.PP
When setting the voltage limit to a value about 1...2 V higher than the current
output voltage, the actual output voltage suddenly jumps to the limit value.
Unfortunately, this is a (known) bug in the DPS firmware, which can also be
triggered from the front panel.
