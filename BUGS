Problem: Sometimes, setting many parameters in one commandline fails. The DPS
will then adjust to seemingly random values.

Solution: This may be related to output buffering of the serial port. Call
dpsctrl multiple times with less parameters to circumvent this.


Problem: When setting the voltage limit to a value nearby the current output
voltage, the actual output voltage suddenly jumps to a higher value.

Solution: There's no real solution. This is a (known) bug in the DPS firmware.
You can also trigger this bug from the front panel. Only solution is to avoid
setting values so the bug will never get triggered. (Thanks to Peter Schildmann
for bringing this to attention!) Actually I was not able to trigger this bug
beyond a difference of about 1V.
